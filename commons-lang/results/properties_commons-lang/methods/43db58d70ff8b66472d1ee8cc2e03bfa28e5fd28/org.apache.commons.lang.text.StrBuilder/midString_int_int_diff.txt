/**
 * Extracts some characters from the middle of the string builder without
 * throwing an exception.
 * <p>
 * This method extracts <code>length</code> characters from the builder
 * at the specified index.
 * If the index is negative it is treated as zero.
 * If the index is greater than the builder size, it is treated as the builder size.
 * If the length is negative, the empty string is returned.
 * If insufficient characters are available in the builder, as much as possible is returned.
 * Thus the returned string may be shorter than the length requested.
 *
 * @param index  the index to start at, negative means zero
 * @param length  the number of characters to extract, negative returns empty string
 * @return the new string
