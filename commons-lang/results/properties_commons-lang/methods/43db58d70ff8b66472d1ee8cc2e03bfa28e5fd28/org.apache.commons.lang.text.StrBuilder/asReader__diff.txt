/**
 * Gets the contents of this builder as a Reader.
 * <p>
 * This method allows the contents of the builder to be read
 * using any standard method that expects a Reader.
 * <p>
 * To use, simply create a <code>StrBuilder</code>, populate it with
 * data, call <code>asReader</code>, and then read away.
 * <p>
 * The internal character array is shared between the builder and the reader.
 * This allows you to append to the builder after creating the reader,
 * and the changes will be picked up.
 * Note however, that no synchronization occurs, so you must perform
 * all operations with the builder and the reader in one thread.
 * <p>
 * The returned reader supports marking, and ignores the flush method.
 *
 * @return a reader that reads from this builder
