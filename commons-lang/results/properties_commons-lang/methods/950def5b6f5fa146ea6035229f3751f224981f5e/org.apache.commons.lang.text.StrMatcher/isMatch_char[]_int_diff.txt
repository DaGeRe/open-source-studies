/**
 * Returns the number of matching characters, zero for no match.
 * <p>
 * This method is called to check for a match.
 * The parameter <code>pos</code> represents the current position to be
 * checked in the string <code>buffer</code> (a character array which must
 * not be changed).
 * The API guarantees that <code>pos</code> is a valid index for <code>buffer</code>.
 * <p>
 * The matching code may check one character or many.
 * It may check characters preceeding <code>pos</code> as well as those after.
 * <p>
 * It must return zero for no match, or a positive number if a match was found.
 * The number indicates the number of characters that matched.
 *
 * @param buffer  the text content to match against, do not change
 * @param pos  the starting position for the match, valid for buffer
 * @return the number of matching characters, zero for no match
 * @since 2.4
