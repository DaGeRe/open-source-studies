/**
 * Gets this builder as a Writer that can be written to.
 * <p>
 * This method allows you to populate the contents of the builder
 * using any standard method that takes a Writer.
 * <p>
 * To use, simply create a <code>StrBuilder</code>,
 * call <code>asWriter</code>, and populate away. The data is available
 * at any time using the methods of the <code>StrBuilder</code>.
 * <p>
 * The internal character array is shared between the builder and the writer.
 * This allows you to intermix calls that append to the builder and
 * write using the writer and the changes will be occur correctly.
 * Note however, that no synchronization occurs, so you must perform
 * all operations with the builder and the writer in one thread.
 * <p>
 * The returned writer ignores the close and flush methods.
 *
 * @return a writer that populates this builder
