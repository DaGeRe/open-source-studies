/**
 * <p>
 * This method uses reflection to build a valid hash code.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It uses <code>AccessibleObject.setAccessible</code> to gain access to private fields. This means that it will
 * throw a security exception if run under a security manager, if the permissions are not set up correctly. It is
 * also not as efficient as testing explicitly.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If the TestTransients parameter is set to <code>true</code>, transient members will be tested, otherwise they
 * are ignored, as they are likely derived fields, and not part of the value of the <code>Object</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Static fields will not be tested. Superclass fields will be included.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Two randomly chosen, non-zero, odd numbers must be passed in. Ideally these should be different for each class,
 * however this is not vital. Prime numbers are preferred, especially for the multiplier.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param initialNonZeroOddNumber
 *            a non-zero, odd number used as the initial value
 * @param multiplierNonZeroOddNumber
 *            a non-zero, odd number used as the multiplier
 * @param object
 *            the Object to create a <code>hashCode</code> for
 * @param testTransients
 *            whether to include transient fields
 * @return int hash code
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException
 *             if the Object is <code>null</code>
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException
 *             if the number is zero or even
