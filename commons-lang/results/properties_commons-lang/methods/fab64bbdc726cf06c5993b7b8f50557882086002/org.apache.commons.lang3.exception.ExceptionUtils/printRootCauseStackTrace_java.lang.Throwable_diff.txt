 * <p>Prints a compact stack trace for the root cause of a throwable

 * stack frames up to the place where it was caught and wrapped.
 * Then it prints the wrapped exception and continues with stack frames
 * until the wrapper exception is caught and wrapped again, etc.</p>
 *
 * <p>The output of this method is consistent across JDK versions.
 * Note that this is the opposite order to the JDK1.4 display.</p>
 *
 * <p>The method is equivalent to <code>printStackTrace</code> for throwables
 * that don't have nested causes.</p>
