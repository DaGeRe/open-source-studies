/**
 * <p>This method uses reflection to determine if the two <code>Object</code>s

 *
 * <p>It uses <code>AccessibleObject.setAccessible</code> to gain access to private
 * fields. This means that it will throw a security exception if run under
 * a security manager, if the permissions are not set up correctly. It is also
 * not as efficient as testing explicitly.</p>
 *
 * <p>If the TestTransients parameter is set to <code>true</code>, transient
 * members will be tested, otherwise they are ignored, as they are likely
 * derived fields, and not part of the value of the <code>Object</code>.</p>
 *
 * <p>Static fields will not be tested. Superclass fields will be included.</p>
 *
 * @param lhs  <code>this</code> object
 * @param rhs  the other object
 * @param testTransients  whether to include transient fields
 * @return <code>true</code> if the two Objects have tested equals.
