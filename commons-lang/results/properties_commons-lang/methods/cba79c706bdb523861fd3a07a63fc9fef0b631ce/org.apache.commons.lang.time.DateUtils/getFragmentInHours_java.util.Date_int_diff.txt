 * <p>Returns the number of hours within the

 * <p>Asking the hours of any date will only return the number of hours
 * of the current day (resulting in a number between 0 and 23). This
 * method will retrieve the number of hours for any fragment.
 * For example, if you want to calculate the number of hours past this month,
 * your fragment is Calendar.MONTH. The result will be all hours of the
 * past day(s).</p>
 *
 * <p>Valid fragments are: Calendar.YEAR, Calendar.MONTH, both
 * Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR and Calendar.DATE, Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY,
 * Calendar.MINUTE, Calendar.SECOND and Calendar.MILLISECOND
 * A fragment less than or equal to a HOUR field will return 0.</p>

 * <ul>
 *  <li>January 1, 2008 7:15:10.538 with Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR as fragment will return 7

 *  <li>January 6, 2008 7:15:10.538 with Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR as fragment will return 7
 *   (equivalent to deprecated date.getHours())</li>
 *  <li>January 1, 2008 7:15:10.538 with Calendar.MONTH as fragment will return 7</li>
 *  <li>January 6, 2008 7:15:10.538 with Calendar.MONTH as fragment will return 127 (5*24 + 7)</li>
 *  <li>January 16, 2008 7:15:10.538 with Calendar.MILLISECOND as fragment will return 0
