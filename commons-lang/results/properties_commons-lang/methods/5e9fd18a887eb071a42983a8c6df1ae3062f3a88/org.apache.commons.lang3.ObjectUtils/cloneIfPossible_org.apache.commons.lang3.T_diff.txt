/**
 * Clone an object if possible. This method is similar to {@link #clone(Object)}, but will
 * return the provided instance as the return value instead of <code>null</code> if the instance
 * is not cloneable. This is more convenient if the caller uses different
 * implementations (e.g. of a service) and some of the implementations do not allow concurrent
 * processing or have state. In such cases the implementation can simply provide a proper
 * clone implementation and the caller's code does not have to change.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the object
 * @param o the object to clone
 * @return the clone if the object implements {@link Cloneable} otherwise the object itself
 * @throws CloneFailedException if the object is cloneable and the clone operation fails
 * @since 3.0
