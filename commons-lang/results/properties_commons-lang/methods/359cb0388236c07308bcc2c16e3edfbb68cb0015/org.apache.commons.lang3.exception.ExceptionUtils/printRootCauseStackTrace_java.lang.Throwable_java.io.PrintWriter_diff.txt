/**
 * <p>Prints a compact stack trace for the root cause of a throwable.</p>
 *
 * <p>The compact stack trace starts with the root cause and prints
 * stack frames up to the place where it was caught and wrapped.
 * Then it prints the wrapped exception and continues with stack frames
 * until the wrapper exception is caught and wrapped again, etc.</p>
 *
 * <p>The output of this method is consistent across JDK versions.
 * Note that this is the opposite order to the JDK1.4 display.</p>
 *
 * <p>The method is equivalent to <code>printStackTrace</code> for throwables
 * that don't have nested causes.</p>
 *
 * @param throwable  the throwable to output, may be null
 * @param writer  the writer to output to, may not be null
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the writer is <code>null</code>
 * @since 2.0
