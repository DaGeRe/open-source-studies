 * <p>Gets the default <code>ToStringStyle</code> to use.</p>
 *
 * <p>This method gets a singleton default value, typically for the whole JVM.
 * Changing this default should generally only be done during application startup.
 * It is recommended to pass a <code>ToStringStyle</code> to the constructor instead
 * of using this global default.</p>
 *
 * <p>This method can be used from multiple threads.
 * Internally, a <code>volatile</code> variable is used to provide the guarantee
 * that the latest value set using {@link #setDefaultStyle} is the value returned.
 * It is strongly recommended that the default style is only changed during application startup.</p>
 *
 * <p>One reason for changing the default could be to have a verbose style during
 * development and a compact style in production.</p>
 *
 * @return the default <code>ToStringStyle</code>, never null
